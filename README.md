# usefulshit
A collection of useful shit I find myself using over and over again; mostly code and scripts 

- Docker folder contains Docker files (currently one) and a example script to build and send a image to docker hub
- Scripts
  - update-notes is the script I use to sync my txt folder over git
  - git-sync is a script to just commit everything with the message Update where you are and do a pull and push
- Golang
  - Makefile: the makefile I use in most project
  - .golangci.yml: the config for https://github.com/golangci/golangci-lint I use.
